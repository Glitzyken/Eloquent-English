        <p class="content__par">
          The sound system comprises <b>the speech sounds</b> which are arranged
          in sequence to give syllables when speaking.
        </p>
        <p class="content__par">
          Speech organs or articulators produce the sounds of language. Organs
          of speech include the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, hard palate, velum
          (soft palate), uvula, glottis and various parts of the tongue.
        </p>
        <p class="content__par">
          The articulators can be divided into two types: Active articulators
          and Passive articulators.
        </p>
        <p class="content__par">
          Active articulators move relatively to passive articulators which
          remain still to produce various speech sounds in particular manners of
          articulation. The upper lip, teeth, alveolar ridge, hard palate, soft
          palate, uvula, and pharynx wall are passive articulators.
        </p>
        <p class="content__par">
          The most important active articulator is the tongue—as it is involved
          in the production of the majority of sounds. The lower lip is another
          active articulator. But glottis is not an active articulator because
          it is only a space between vocal folds.
        </p>
        <p class="content__par">
          During production of any sound, the organs of speech are involved.
          Knowing the right organ to use during production of any speech sound
          will help you pronounce the sounds correctly.

        </p>
        <p class="content__par">
          To know the correct pronunciation of a word, you need to check the
          transcription of the word. When using your dictionary, you get to see
          that after the word, you get the transcription. For example, look up
          the word “October” in the dictionary. You will notice that after the
          word, the transcription follows /ɒk’təʊbə/ (British) while /ɒk’toʊbər/
          is America.
        </p>
        <p class="content__par">
          In Oxford dictionary, the British transcription is usually the first,

        <p class="content__par">
          In other dictionaries, the British pronunciation is written as “UK”

          Therefore, it is a bilabial consonant.

          Consonant /r/ is articulated with the tip of the tongue coming near
          the alveolar ridge but the tip of the tongue won’t touch the ridge.
          The rim of the tongue touches the upper molars while airstream passes
          over the center of the tongue without friction. The vocal cords
          vibrate as the /r/ sound is produced. Therefore, the /r/ sound is a
          voiced frictionless liquid.

                  need to know that for each sound, there are different spelling
                  variants where the letter or the combination of two letters
                  come together to give us a particular sound. It should be
                  noted that a letter does not dictate the sound it should have,
                  rather, the sound tells us how the letter should be pronounced
                  because letter is to writing while sound is to speech.</p>

                  Monophthongs (pure vowels): They are single vowels and twelve
                  in number. The pure vowels are divided into two parts, the
                  long vowels and the short sounds. The long vowel can be
                  identified with a (:) which is called the length mark.

                <p class="content__par">Whenever you see a sound with the Length
                  mark (:), note that the duration of time needed for the
                  pronunciation of the sound is longer than that of a word
                  without the length mark (:). Therefore, a word with the length
                  mark is stressed.</p>
