# EloquentEnglish

This project was created using Angular. It is the source code for my website. The website is about my books - Become a Master of English IPA and Become an Eloquent English Speaker - where one can read the content of the book for free.

To make sure that you enjoy the reading experience, I coded the platform in a beautiful UI (just like it looks on the actual book) and UX responsive to any screen size. So whether you are reading from a mobile phone, tablet or laptop, you can be sure to get a good reading experience.

More features and sections will be added to the web app later. Thanks for using this platform.
